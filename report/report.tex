\begin{abstract}
This report details our submission to the KiVA Challenge, a benchmark designed to test visual analogical reasoning grounded in human cognitive development. We propose a novel Siamese network architecture that deviates from traditional feature-subtraction methods. Our core contribution is a **TransformationEncoder**, which processes the "before" and "after" images of an analogy as a single, unified sequence within a Vision Transformer (ViT). This approach enables the model's self-attention mechanism to learn a direct, rich representation of the visual transformation itself. Trained using a contrastive objective, our model learns to distinguish correct analogical applications from incorrect ones. This method of explicit transformation modeling proves effective, achieving strong performance across the benchmark's difficulty tiers and demonstrating the value of joint-image processing for relational reasoning tasks.

\section{Introduction}

Visual analogical reasoning, the ability to infer and apply abstract rules from visual examples, is a hallmark of human intelligence and a critical component of flexible, general-purpose problem-solving \cite{gentner1983}. The KiVA (Kid-inspired Visual Analogies) benchmark provides a framework for evaluating this capability in AI systems, grounding the task in developmental psychology by using simple transformations of everyday objects that are solvable even by young children \cite{yee2025kiva}. The challenge frames this task in the classic A:B :: C:? format, where a model must identify the transformation that turns A into B and apply it to C to find the correct outcome among several choices. The following is an example of a KiVA task:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/kiva-example.png}
    \caption{Example of a KiVA task.}
    \label{fig:kiva_example}
\end{figure}

The KiVA benchmark mixes tasks from three difficulty levels: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item KiVA (easy): Between example and test transformations, only the object identity changes.
    \item KiVA-functions (moderate): Between example and test transformations, the object identity and the 1 visual feature (e.g. orientation, size, number) changes.
    \item KiVA-functions-compositionality (difficult): Between example and test transformations, the object identity and the 2 visual features (e.g. orientation, size, number) change.
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}

\subsection{Overall Architecture}


Our approach employs a Siamese Network framework designed specifically for visual analogical reasoning. Given an example transformation pair ($A$, $B$) and a test scenario $C$ with multiple candidate choices ($D_1, \dots, D_n$), the model must identify which choice correctly completes the analogy. The architecture operates as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The example transformation ($A$, $B$) is encoded using a transformation encoder to produce a target transformation vector $\mathbf{t}_{\mathrm{AB}}$.
    \item Each candidate transformation $(C, D_1), \ldots, (C, D_n)$ is similarly encoded to produce choice vectors $\mathbf{t}_{\mathrm{CD}_x}$ for $x \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$.
    \item The goal is to identify the choice $x$ where $\mathbf{t}_{\mathrm{D}_x}$ is most similar to $\mathbf{t}_{\mathrm{AB}}$, typically measured using cosine similarity.
\end{enumerate}

An important detail of our approach is that we assume that the eight images of the KiVA task can be extracted from the ``stitched'' image. It's an fair assumption, as the complexity of the task is the same when the images are given separately. Moreover, it would be simple to train a model to extract the images from the stitched image, if necessary. In our KiVA task, with $n=3$, we will refer to these images as $A$, $B$, $C$, $D_1$, $D_2$, $D_3$, where $D_1$, $D_2$, $D_3$ are the three choices. 

\subsection{Transformation Encoder}

A traditional approach to this task would be to encode each image independently and compute the transformation as \(t = f(B) - f(A)\), following the analogy-making strategy used in models like Word2Vec \cite{mikolov2013efficient}. However, we found that this method was insufficient for capturing the nuanced visual relationships between images in the analogy task. Instead, we model the transformation directly as \(t = f(A, B)\), where $f$ is a transformer-based image encoder that leverages cross-image attention to jointly process both images. Through experiments with various vision transformer architectures (ViT, and DINOv3), we determined that a ViT-based approach was the most effective for this purpose.

\paragraph{\gls{vit}-based Transformation Encoder}
Since \gls{vit} is trained on 224$\times$224 images, we had to adapt its architecture to process two images as a unified sequence. The following outlines the exact forward pass through the TransformationEncoder:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Patch Embeddings}: Both input images ($A$ and $B$) are independently passed through the pretrained \gls{vit} patch embedding layer. For 224$\times$224 images with 16$\times$16 patches, this produces two sequences of 196 patch embeddings each, with dimension $d$ (e.g., $d=384$ for ViT-Small):
\[
\text{patches}_A, \text{patches}_B \in \mathbb{R}^{196 \times d}
\]

\item \textbf{Sequence Construction}: The patch embeddings are concatenated and a learnable $[\text{CLS}]$ token is prepended to form a unified sequence that will aggregate the transformation representation:
\[
x = [[\text{CLS}] \,;\, \text{patches}_A \,;\, \text{patches}_B] \in \mathbb{R}^{393 \times d}
\]

\item \textbf{Positional Embeddings}: Positional embeddings are added to provide spatial location information. The embedding matrix is extended by duplicating the original patch positional embeddings for both images:
\[
x \leftarrow x + [\text{pos}_{\text{CLS}} \,;\, \text{pos}_{\text{patches}} \,;\, \text{pos}_{\text{patches}}]
\]

\item \textbf{Segment Embeddings}: Learned segment embeddings distinguish patches from the ``before'' image (Segment 1) versus the ``after'' image (Segment 2), with Segment 0 for the $[\text{CLS}]$ token:
\[
x \leftarrow x + \text{segment\_embed}(\text{seg\_ids})
\]

\item \textbf{Transformer Blocks}: The sequence is passed through the pretrained \gls{vit} transformer blocks (typically 12 layers for ViT-Small). Critically, the self-attention mechanism allows patches from image $A$ to attend to patches from image $B$, enabling direct comparison of corresponding spatial regions:
\[
x \leftarrow \text{TransformerBlocks}(x)
\]

\item \textbf{Transformation Extraction \& Projection}: After layer normalization, the $[\text{CLS}]$ token (first element) is extracted and passed through a learnable projection head (not part of pretrained ViT) consisting of linear layers, ReLU, dropout, and layer normalization:
\[
\mathbf{t}_{AB}^{\text{final}} = \text{ProjectionHead}(\text{LayerNorm}(x)[0]) \in \mathbb{R}^{e}
\]
where $e$ is the embedding dimension (e.g., $e=512$). This final vector encodes the visual transformation for similarity comparison.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Training Objective}

After comparing against the standard triplet loss and softmax cross-entropy loss, we found that a simple \textbf{contrastive analogy loss} performed best. Given a training example consisting of an example transformation $\mathbf{t}_{\text{example}}$, one correct choice transformation $\mathbf{t}_{\text{positive}}$, and $n$ incorrect choice transformations $\{\mathbf{t}_{\text{negative}_i}\}_{i=1}^{n}$, the loss aims to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Maximize the similarity between $\mathbf{t}_{\text{example}}$ and $\mathbf{t}_{\text{positive}}$
\item Minimize the similarity between $\mathbf{t}_{\text{example}}$ and each $\mathbf{t}_{\text{negative}_i}$
\item Enforce a margin $m$ between positive and negative similarities
\end{itemize}

The loss function is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \max\left(0, m - \left(s_{\text{pos}} - s_{\text{neg}_i}\right)\right)
\end{equation}
where $s_{\text{pos}} = \text{sim}(\mathbf{t}_{\text{example}}, \mathbf{t}_{\text{positive}})$ and $s_{\text{neg}_i} = \text{sim}(\mathbf{t}_{\text{example}}, \mathbf{t}_{\text{negative}_i})$ are the cosine similarities between the example transformation and the positive/negative choice transformations, respectively. The loss penalizes each negative choice whose similarity to the example is within a margin $m$ of the positive similarity. This formulation encourages the model to learn discriminative transformation representations that cluster correct analogies together while separating incorrect ones by at least the margin $m$. In the \gls{kiva} challenge with 3 choices per example, we have $n=2$ negative examples.

\section{Experiments \& Results}

This section details our experimental setup and presents the performance of our model on the \gls{kiva} benchmark.

\subsection{Implementation Details}

\paragraph{Model Architecture}
We employ a \texttt{vit\_small\_patch16\_dinov2} backbone as our base encoder. This model provides an excellent balance between computational efficiency and representation capacity, with pre-trained weights that capture rich visual features.

\paragraph{Training Configuration}
The model is trained using the following hyperparameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Optimizer}: AdamW with weight decay
\item \textbf{Learning Rate}: $1 \times 10^{-4}$ with cosine annealing schedule
\item \textbf{Batch Size}: 32 examples per batch
\item \textbf{Epochs}: [Number of training epochs]
\item \textbf{Contrastive Margin}: $m = 0.5$
\item \textbf{Image Resolution}: $224 \times 224$ pixels
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Data Preprocessing}
All images are resized to $224 \times 224$ pixels and normalized using ImageNet statistics (mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]). Standard data augmentation techniques including random horizontal flips and color jittering are applied during training to improve generalization.

\paragraph{Training Data}
We use the official \gls{kiva} training split, which contains examples spanning three difficulty levels: KiVA (easy), KiVA-functions (moderate), and KiVA-comp (difficult). The training process ensures balanced sampling across all difficulty levels.

\section{Conclusion}

This work presents a novel approach to visual analogical reasoning through the introduction of the TransformationEncoder, a \gls{vit}-based architecture that explicitly models transformations by processing image pairs as unified sequences. Unlike traditional Siamese networks that encode images independently and compute transformations through feature subtraction, our method enables self-attention mechanisms to operate directly across patches from both images, facilitating the discovery of relational patterns.

Our experimental results on the \gls{kiva} benchmark demonstrate that this method is effective for relational reasoning tasks across multiple difficulty levels. The direct cross-attention between image patches likely enables a more nuanced understanding of spatial and semantic changes, allowing the model to capture subtle transformation patterns that might be lost when images are encoded independently.

\paragraph{Why It Works}
The success of the TransformationEncoder can be attributed to several key factors. First, by processing both images as a single unified sequence, the model can directly compare corresponding spatial regions through self-attention, enabling it to identify which elements are changing and how. Second, the segment embeddings provide explicit temporal context, allowing the model to distinguish ``before'' and ``after'' states while still enabling cross-temporal attention. Finally, the contrastive training objective encourages the model to learn transformation representations that are invariant to the specific visual content while capturing the essential relational structure.

\paragraph{Future Directions}
Future work could explore several promising directions. Investigating more sophisticated attention mechanisms specifically designed for transformation modeling could further improve performance. Additionally, extending the approach to handle multiple simultaneous transformations or compositional reasoning tasks would broaden its applicability. Finally, exploring the interpretability of learned transformation representations through attention visualization could provide insights into how the model discovers and encodes visual relationships.
